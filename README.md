Genix is an early-stage game engine for Windows.
The project was developed for learning purposes and to gain experience in engine architecture and graphics pipeline.

## Getting Started
  Visual Studio 2022 is required. Not tested on early versions or other platforms.

1. Downloading the repository:

Start by cloning the repository with `git clone --recursive https://github.com/halukoral/Genix`.

If the repository was cloned non-recursively previously, use `git submodule update --init` to clone the necessary submodules.

2. Configuring the dependencies:

Run the Setup.bat file found in scripts folder. This will download the required prerequisites for the project if they are not present yet.

## Roadmap
1. DirectX12 and Vulkan implementation
2. Path tracing
3. Animation system
4. Audio system
5. UI system
6. Physics system
7. Particle system
